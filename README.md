A Recursive Formula for Estimating Prime Number Density 
VARUN MENON 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for estimating the proportion of prime numbers up to a given 
upper bound. It is based on a recursive approach inspired by the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This method 
works by taking the range of numbers given and iteratively removing the percentages of composite 
numbers that have specific prime factors. This approach is specific and flexible and can be applied to 
different ranges, providing a systematic way to estimate the prime density, similar to the Prime Number 
Theorem. A Python script is included to demonstrate test results using this method in comparison to 
actual values and values predicted by the Prime Number Theorem.
